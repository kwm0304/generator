# Spring MVC Generator

Spring MVC Generator is a command line tool that generates boilerplate code for Spring Boot MVC projects. The user provides path to their model/entity directory, and generator makes controller, repository, service, and optional security directories and files based on model information. The problem this program aims to solve is the amount of boilerplate needed to get up and running in a Spring Boot project.
